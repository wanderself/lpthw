# The Hard Way Is Easier - 笨方至简

通过本书的帮助，你将会做一些非常简单的事情，即凡程序猿者必经之路：
> 
* Go through each exercise. - 完成每一次训练
* Type in each sample exactly. - 一字不漏的敲出每个实例
* Make it run. - 运行程序

就是这样。开始的时候会有点难，但要坚持下去。如果你理解了这本书，并且每晚花点时间去做些练习，你就会在阅读其他进一步学习Python的书时有巨大的成就感。这本书不会让你一夜之间就成为程序猿，但是它会让你踏上学习编程之路。
```
本书的目的就是教你三个程序猿菜鸟必知的最屌技能：
· 多看多敲
· 注重细节
· 发现不同
```
### Reading and Writing - 多看多敲   
如果你有打字障碍，特别是如果你对在源码中敲出一些不太常用的字符的话，那么你就会有编程障碍。若是没有这点简单的技能，你甚至都无法学习最基本的软件开发。

敲实例代码并运行之，会帮你学习那些符号的命名，熟练的敲出它们，并能让你理解这门编程语言。


### Attention to Detail - 注重细节   
注重细节是体现程序猿孰优孰劣的一个技能。实际上，在任何行业中都是如此。你必须注意一些极其微小的细节，否则将会错过你所创建的重要的东西。在编程中，这就是为何你会以bug告终或是搞出了一个傻逼系统。

撸完这本书，并彻底敲一遍每个实例代码，你将会训练你的大脑把注意力集中在你正在做的事情上。

### Spotting Differences - 发现不同   
一个非常重要的技能（大多数程序猿随着开发经验增加）就是能够直观地注意到事物之间的差别。一个程序猿老鸟能够看到两段略有不同的代码就可以立即指出其间的差异。程序猿可以用开发工具来使这些事变得更简单，但是我们不提倡使用。你必须先用笨方法训练你的大脑，然后再使用开发工具。

你在做这些练习的时候，每敲一次，都可能会犯错。这是不可避免的；即使是老鸟也偶尔会这样。你需要做的是对比你所敲的代码，并解决所有的冲突。通过这样，你将会训练你自己去注意那些失误，漏洞，和其他的问题。

### Do Not Copy-Paste - 千万别玩复制粘贴   
If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.  
你必须亲手去把每一个练习都敲一遍。如果你复制粘贴，那可能相当于你什么都没做。这些练习题的关键在于训练你的双手，你的大脑，和你如何读、写、理解代码的思维。如果你复制粘贴，那只是自欺欺人而已。

### Using the Included Videos - 看一下内置视频   
Learn Python The Hard Way has more than 5 hours of instructional videos to help you with the book. There is one video for each exercise where I either demonstrate the exercise, or give you tips for completing the exercise. The best way to use the videos is to attempt or complete the exercises without them first, then use the videos to review what you learned or if you are stuck. This will slowly wean you off of using videos to learn programming and build your skills at understanding code directly. Stick with it, and slowly you won't need the videos, or any videos to learn programming. You'll be able to just read for the information you need.

### A Note on Practice and Persistence - 注意练习并持之以恒   
While you are studying programming, I'm studying how to play guitar. I practice it every day for at least two hours a day. I play scales, chords, and arpeggios for an hour and then learn music theory, ear training, songs, and anything else I can. Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours because I feel like it and it's fun. To me repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn something. I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it's difficult. Keep trying and eventually it'll be easier and fun.

Between the time that I wrote Learn Python The Hard Way and Learn Ruby The Hard Way I discovered drawing and painting. I fell in love with making visual art at the age of 39 and have been spending every day studying it in much the same way that I studied guitar, music, and programming. I collected books of instructional material, did what the books said, painted every day, and focused on enjoying the process of learning. I am by no means an "artist", or even that good, but I can now say that I can draw and paint. The same method I'm teaching you in this book applied to my adventures in art. If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.

As you study this book, and continue with programming, remember that anything worth doing is difficult at first. Maybe you are the kind of person who is afraid of failure so you give up at the first sign of difficulty. Maybe you never learned self-discipline so you can't do anything that's "boring." Maybe you were told that you are "gifted" so you never attempt anything that might make you seem stupid or not a prodigy. Maybe you are competitive and unfairly compare yourself to someone like me who's been programming for more than 20 years.

Whatever your reason for wanting to quit, keep at it. Force yourself. If you run into a Study Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand, then skip it and come back to it later. Just keep going because with programming there's this very odd thing that happens. At first, you will not understand anything. It'll be weird, just like with learning any human language. You will struggle with words, and not know what symbols are what, and it'll all be very confusing. Then one day BANG your brain will snap and you will suddenly "get it." If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to understand them, you will get it. You might not be a master coder, but you will at least understand how programming works.

If you give up, you won't ever reach this point. You will hit the first confusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep trying, keep typing it in, trying to understand it and reading about it, you will eventually get it. If you go through this whole book, and you still do not understand how to code, at least you gave it a shot. You can say you tried your best and a little more and it didn't work out, but at least you tried. You can be proud of that.

> A Warning for the Smarties - 对自作聪明者的小警告   
Sometimes people who already know a pogrramming language will read this book and feel I'm insulting them. There is nothing in this book that is intended to be interperetd as condescending, insutling, or belittling. I simply know more about programming than my intended readers. If  tyouhink you are smarter than me, then you will feel talked down to and there's nothing I can do about that because you are not my intended reader.
>
If you are reading this book and flipping out at every third sentence because you feel I'm insulting your intelligence, then I have three points of advice for you:
>
* Stop reading my book. I didn't write it for you. I wrote it for people who don't already know everything.  
* Empty before you fill. You will have a ahrd time learning from someone with more knowledge if you already know everything.   
* Go learn Lisp. I hear people who know everything really like Lisp.  

For everyone else who's here to learn, just read everything as if I'm smiling and I have a mischievous little twinkle in my eye.
